Resume:
${resumeContent}

Job Description for the ${jobTitle} position at ${companyName}:
${jobDescription}

Step 1: Analyze the alignment between the candidate and the job by:
- Extracting key technical and soft skills from both the resume and the job description
- Evaluating the candidate's experience level relative to the role
- Highlighting major responsibilities outlined in the job description
- Identifying any technical or experience gaps
- Considering potential cultural fit based on the company's known values and role expectations

Step 2: Generate exactly ${numberOfQuestions} interview questions that:
- Reflect a ${difficultyLevel} difficulty level
- Include a balance of technical and behavioral questions
- Target areas where there are skill gaps or high-value responsibilities
- Assess both required competencies and alignment with company culture
- Are directly relevant to the ${jobTitle} position at ${companyName}

CRITICAL: You must return ONLY a valid JSON array of strings containing the questions. No other text, no code blocks, no backticks. The response should start with [ and end with ]. Example:
["Tell me about your experience with...", "How would you handle...", "What approach would you take..."]

Voice assistant guidelines:
- Keep language natural and conversational
- Avoid using symbols or punctuation like slashes (/) or asterisks (*)
- Ensure each question is clearly phrased for spoken delivery`,
